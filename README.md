## About

HIPE is a shared task organised in the context of the [impresso](http://impresso-project.ch) project, and accepted as a [CLEF 2020](https://clef2020.clef-initiative.eu/) Evaluation Lab.  Its goal is to carry out a named entity processing evaluation campaign on diachronic newspapers material in French, German and English.

## Corpus

The corpus will be composed of French, German and English newspaper articles sampled among eight Swiss, Luxembourgish and British/American (still TBD) historical newspapers on a diachronic basis. It will be publicly released as part of the shared task.

## Evaluation tasks

**Task 1**: Named Entity Recognition and Classification (NERC)

- **Subtask 1.1** *NERC Essentials*: this task includes the recognition and classification of high-
level entity types (Person, Organisation, Location, Product)
- **Subtask 1.2** *NERC fine-grained*: includes ‘NERC Essentials’, plus the detection and
classification at sub-type level and the detection of NE components (e.g. function, title, name)

**Task 2**: Named Entity Linking (EL).

- **Subtask 2.1** *Entity coreference resolution*: given a set of mentions within and across
documents, the objective is to cluster coreferent mentions and give them a cross-document
identifier.
- **Subtask 2.2** *Entity Linking*: this task includes the linking of named entity mentions to a
unique referent in a knowledge base (KB) or to a NIL node if the mention does not have a
referent in the KB. The chosen KB is [Wikidata](https://wikidata.org).
