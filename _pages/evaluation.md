- Scorers will be published at the same time of training data.
- Named Entity Recognition and Classification (Task 1) will be evaluated in terms of macro and micro Precision, Recall, F-measure, and Slot Error Rate. Two evaluation scenarios will be considered: strict (exact boundary matching) and relaxed (fuzzy boundary matching).
- Entity linking (Task 2) will be evaluated in terms of Precision, Recall and F-measure.
