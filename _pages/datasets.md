### Corpora

Evaluation corpora will be composed of articles sampled among several Swiss, Luxembourgish and British/American (still TBD) historical newspapers on a diachronic basis. Articles and accompanying metadata will be publicly released as part of the shared task.

**Corpus selection**

For each language, articles of 4 different newspapers were sampled on a decade time-bucket basis, according to the time span of the newspaper (longest duration spans ca. 200 years).

The following selection criteria were used:

- Progammatic:
  - articles should have a title
  - articles should have more than 50 characters
  - articles are not restricted to front page only

- Manual:
  - keep: journalistic content
  - remove: feuilleton, tabular data, cross-words, meteo, time-schedules, obituaries, and what a human cannot even read because of OCR noise.


**Data sets**

For each language and task, the following data sets will be released:

- sample (end of November): a few raw and annotated articles so that participants could know what to expect;
- training (end of January): raw and annotated articles;
- dev (end of January): raw and annotated articles.


**Formats**

More information on training and system response formats to come end of october.


**OCR quality**

OCR quality corresponds to real-life setting, i.e. it varies according to digitization time and archival material. We do not provide different OCR versions of same texts, but will provide an OCR quality assessment measure alongside each article, as well as images (to be confirmed).


**Tagset, Annotation campaign & inter-annotator agreements**

More information to come during winter 2019-20.
