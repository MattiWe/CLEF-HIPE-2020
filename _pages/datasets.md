The shared tasks corpora are composed of articles sampled among several Swiss, Luxembourgish and American historical newspapers on a diachronic basis.

Data acquisition and format are described in the [HIPE - Shared Task Participation Guidelines](https://zenodo.org/record/3677171).

#### Data sets:

- **Sample data** for French and German is available **[HERE](https://github.com/impresso/CLEF-HIPE-2020/tree/2020-01-10/data/)**. It consists of 10 French and 8 German content items fully annotated.
- **Training and dev data sets** version 1.0 are available **[HERE](https://github.com/impresso/CLEF-HIPE-2020/tree/master/data)**.



#### Auxiliary resources

- HIPE will provide ‘in domain’ word-level and character-level embeddings acquired from historical newspaper corpora.
- Participants will be encouraged (but not forced) to share any  external resource they might use, during and/or after the evaluation  campaign.
