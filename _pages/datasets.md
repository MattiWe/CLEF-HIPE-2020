The shared tasks corpora are composed of articles sampled among several Swiss, Luxembourgish and American historical newspapers on a diachronic basis.

Data acquisition and format are described in the [HIPE - Shared Task Participation Guidelines]().

**Data sets**:

- **Sample data** for French and German is available **[HERE](https://github.com/impresso/CLEF-HIPE-2020/tree/master/data/)**. It consists of 10 French and 8 German content items fully annotated.
- **Training and dev data sets** will be available on 14 February 2020.

**Auxiliary resources**

- HIPE will provide ‘in domain’ word-level and character-level embeddings acquired from historical newspaper corpora.
- Participants will be encouraged (but not forced) to share any  external resource they might use, during and/or after the evaluation  campaign.
