HIPE (Identifying Historical People, Places and other Entities) is a **named entity processing evaluation campaign** on **historical newspapers** in **French**, **German** and **English**, organized in the context of the [_impresso_](http://impresso-project.ch) project and run as a [CLEF 2020](https://clef2020.clef-initiative.eu/) Evaluation Lab.

### Motivation

Since its introduction some twenty years ago, named entity (NE) processing has become an essential component of virtually any text mining application and has undergone major changes. Recently, two main trends characterise its developments: the adoption of deep learning architectures, and the consideration of textual material originating from historical and cultural heritage collections. While the former opens up new opportunities, the latter introduces new challenges with heterogeneous, historical and noisy inputs. If NE processing tools are increasingly being used in the context of historical documents, performances are below the ones on contemporary data and are hardly comparable. In this context,  the objective of HIPE is threefold:

1. to strengthen the robustness of existing approaches on non-standard input;
2. to enable performance comparison of NE processing on historical texts;
   and, in the long run,
3. to foster efficient semantic indexing of historical documents in order to support scholarship on digital cultural heritage collections.
