**Task 1: Named Entity Recognition and Classification (NERC)**

- **Subtask 1.1 - NERC Essentials**: this task includes the recognition and classification of high-
  level entity types: Person, Organisation, Location and Product.
- **Subtask 1.2 - NERC fine-grained**: includes ‘NERC Essentials’, plus the detection and
  classification at sub-type level (e.g. Person-individual vs. Person-collective) and the detection of NE components (e.g. function, title, name).

**Task 2 : Named Entity Linking (EL)**

- **Subtask 2.1 - Entity coreference resolution**: given a set of mentions,
cluster them into coreferent sets and give them a unique identifier.
- **Subtask 2.2 - Entity Linking**: this task includes the linking of named entity mentions to a
  unique referent in a knowledge base (KB) or to a NIL node if the mention does not have a
  referent in the KB. The chosen KB is [Wikidata](https://wikidata.org).
